# Facebook_social_networkR
R code, data, and environment to create a social network plot of mutual friends on Facebook. Identification of people and networks has been coded to protect identities.
'association_GIT_final.csv' is a dataframe containing (1) the friend number, (2) the social group which I have organized them to (based on how I know them), and (3) the friend code, which is their name.
'network_GIT_final.csv' is the network matrix (427x427)
'FB_Social_Circles_GIT.R' is the script to create the network analysis plot in R.
'FB_Social_circles_GIT.RDATA' is the R environment containing all the objects.
