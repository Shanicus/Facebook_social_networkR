# Facebook_social_networkR
R code, data, and environment to create a social network plot of mutual friends on Facebook as seen in the blog post <a href="https://seaturtlessg.wordpress.com/2019/04/19/mutual-friends-network-analysis-in-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mutual Friends Network Analysis in R</a>. People's identity and the social circles they're in have been coded to protect identities.</br></br>
'association_GIT_final.csv' is a dataframe containing (1) the friend number, (2) the social group which I have organized them to (based on how I know them), and (3) the friend code, which is their name.</br></br>
'network_GIT_final.csv' is the network matrix (427x427)</br></br>
'FB_Social_Circles_GIT.R' is the script to create the network analysis plot in R.</br></br>
'FB_Social_circles_GIT.RDATA' is the R environment containing all the objects.</br></br>
